1) Prepare the circuit with temperature sensors 

2) Launch Arduino program
Load: TemperatureLM35/temp_LM35D_multi/temp_LM35D_multi.ino
- You can select how many temperature sensors you want.

(list serial ports: ls /dev/{tty,cu}.* to fine the serial port)
(screen -L /dev/tty.usbXXXXX 9600 to see the output of arduino directly from
command line)

3) Write output on txt file with timestamp
cd  TemperatureLM35
python temp_LM35D.py 
- set the output file name

4) Make ROOT tree with temperature and time info
python makeTree_temp_LM35D.py 
- set how many sensors you have

5) PLot temperature vs time
python plot_temp_LM35D.py
WORKS ONLY FOR 1 SENSOR (FOR THE MOMENT)
